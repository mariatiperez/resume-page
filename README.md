This is my personal web page, here you can find a little bit information about me and use it as a template if you want!

I create a new project using ReactJS and Styled Components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Credits

To create this project I base my design on [Tim Baker's Project](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template).

I got the icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/).

And the photo slider from this [React-Slideshow NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-slideshow-image).
